APPLICATION DESCRIPTION
Our project, Draw!, is a doodling application. It holds a series of drawing tools, shape tools, and effects for the user to play around with. There are several color presets, as well as additional, more advanced color options, and background color options. 
HOW TO RUN
Due to the fact that we have implemented additional stylings with CSS, our project cannot be run in IntelliJ (except for the Ultimate version). It works with any text editor (Atom, Brackets, Sublime, etc.) + terminal. Compile normally.
When the application opens, the default tool is set to pencil, and the default color is black, allowing you to immediately draw. 
The drawing tools, shape tools, effect tools, brush size slider, and default colors can be found in the conventional left side toolbar. Here you can also find the “Canvas Colors” drop-down menu, which changes the background color, as well as the “More Colors” drop-down menu which provides additional drawing tool color options.
Exit, Help, and Clear All can be found in the menu bar along the top of the window, present with their keyboard shortcuts.

ONE FEATURE YOU WISHED YOU COULD IMPLEMENT:
We originally hoped to implement Undo/Redo and Export functions, however, the difficulty of creating these features was too much for the timeframe, so we were unable to successfully implement them.
